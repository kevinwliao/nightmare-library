# nightmare-library
This algorithmic composition, inspired by Paul Lansky, is titled "Nightmare Library." It is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by the noise of a library, and wanting to shush somebody, but realizing that nobody is actually talking. The primary gesture of the piece is listening to an array of mundane library sounds build up, ramping up in density (and thus perceived volume) over time. Using randomized panning and right and left reverb channels, I wanted to create a realistic sense of space to pair with the completely absurd cacophany of noise created by sporking so many shreds at the same time. The second section is more explicitly tonal and rhythmic, utilizing the sound of a printer through a comb filter to create a distorted-sounding bass that provides the ground for the upcoming composition, as well as fax sounds panned through the code.

Parallel to the .ck file, create two directories "sounds" and "altered sounds" and populate them with the correct files.

Run the .ck file "nightmarelibrarym0.ck" in order to hear an instantiation of the piece, which will be slightly different from the provided wav file, due to the randomization involved in the process.
